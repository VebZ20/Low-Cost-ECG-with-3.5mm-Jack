# Low-Cost-ECG-via-3.5mm-Jack
# Setup
 Requires PyQT5 and Python 3.9 or up

+To Run this file you need to do some adjustments first.

Right click on the Run.bat file and edit the directory where Python is installed and paste it there. Make Sure that the Python you have, there is PyQT5 installed, because it won't work without it. This codes are written in Python 3.9 version.

To Run this file just click on the Run.bat file after giving it the python.exe directory path. And you're done =)!
# Circuit Design

# Results
As you can see there is a lot of noise. You can reduce this noise by making the PCB, this is simply done on the breadboard and with 3 metal strip as leads.
Better Results can be obtained if you use high quality material, otherwise you can just take the R peak and count the beats.
